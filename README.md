# Awesome

This is a toy language called _Awesome_ I'm building based on the instructions
in [How To Create Your Own Freaking Awesome Programming Language][1] by
Marc-Andr√© Cournoyer.

Here are the language guidelines, taken directly from the book.

- As in Python, blocks of code are delimited by their indentation.
- Classes are declared with the class keyword.
- Methods can be defined anywhere using the def keyword.
- Identifiers starting with a capital letter are constants which are globally
  accessible.
- Lower-case identifiers are local variables or method names.
- If a method has a receiver and no argument, parenthesis can be skipped, much
  like in Ruby. Eg.: self.print is the same as self.print().
- The last value evaluated in a method is its return value.
- Everything is an object.
